# Skill-Issue
## The VRC Skills Copilot

---
Skill Issue is a powerful desktop-based application that allows individuals to analyze their VRC Robot Skills with time. The application allows users to input unofficial skills scores, see others skills scores online, observe and analyze their own skills progression, and export data for use in their engineering notebooks. The program also features a powerful algorithm which can tokenize and break down skills circuits, and give tips on how to improve it.

### Roadmap
#### b1.0.1: GUI (in progress) <<<
- Create a custom GUI module in Python based on the Pygame library to easily display all possible GUI elements, from buttons, text boxes, sliders, scrollable lists, etc.

#### b1.0.2: Working Model (planned)
- Finalize a first working model of the program that allows inputting of skills scores, creation of graphs and exporting data, as well as the ability to access the dummy scroll menu of online skills scores.

#### b1.0.3: Web Syncing (planned)
- Create a framework for the program to directly access an online data storage system that contains all posted unofficial skills scores to display on the "feed". Finalize authentication system for teams to ensure no one else but them can post skills scores for their team.

#### b1.0.4: Deployment (planned)
- Host a website where users can download the program onto their computers and try it for themselves.

#### b1.0.5: Tokenization Algorithm (planned)
- Develop algorithm to break down skills scores, use a combination of prewritten knowledge and online resources to compile tips for the user.
